This is where the magic happens. Other than a few changes
to the commenting form in wp-includes, this is just a 
retular wordpress install.  (I have included the whole 
wordpress code base here in case I make other changes 
to includes).  

The theme basically transforms your website into a gated
site. All users must have a login, and that login has 
to be created by the administrator. Read on to find out
more about the theme's capabilities: 

What this theme does. 
1) Create a home page, 
2) Category pages based on your wordpress categories, 
3) An admin page to control the hero banner, 
4) Nice commenting capabilities from the home page, cat 
pages, and single pages
5) Some slick JQuery to show and hide forms
6) Generally be awesome.
7) There are some particular rules around permissions in 
this theme, it assumes no view access to members who are 
not registered with the site, but this should be easy to 
change. 
  - When the user reaches the login page, they log in to 
  site, not to the wordpress admin screen
  - The wordpress toolbar should be removed from the top 
  of the page for all users who are not admin. 
  - The 3 user levels I use are: 
    1- Administrator // Has access to all wordpress admin
    2- Author  // Create posts and comment
    3- Subscriber // view and comment only
